<img src="images/java.jpeg" alt="" width="290" height="174">
<p>Computer programming is the process of performing a particular computation (or more generally, accomplishing a specific computing result), usually by designing and building an executable computer program. Programming involves tasks such as analysis, generating algorithms, profiling algorithms' accuracy and resource consumption, and the implementation of algorithms (usually in a chosen programming language, commonly referred to as coding).[1][2] The source code of a program is written in one or more languages that are intelligible to programmers, rather than machine code, which is directly executed by the central processing unit. The purpose of programming is to find a sequence of instructions that will automate the performance of a task (which can be as complex as an operating system) on a computer, often for solving a given problem. Proficient programming thus usually requires expertise in several different subjects, including knowledge of the application domain, specialized algorithms, and formal logic.

Tasks accompanying and related to programming include testing, debugging, source code maintenance, implementation of build systems, and management of derived artifacts, such as the machine code of computer programs. These might be considered part of the programming process, but often the term software development is used for this larger process with the term programming, implementation, or coding reserved for the actual writing of code. Software engineering combines engineering techniques with software development practices. Reverse engineering is a related process used by designers, analysts, and programmers to understand an existing program and re-implement its function</p>

<p style="font-style: italic">exciting – and at times overwhelming – things about it is just how much there is to learn.

You'll discover different languages, frameworks, libraries, inventions and conventions.

One technology often requires knowledge of another one, and everything seems to be interconnected and intertwined.

With new technologies coming out often in such a fast paced and ever-changing industry, it can quickly get confusing for beginner coders.

When learning how to code, instead of just focusing on learning a specific technology, it can also help to learn the foundations – the building blocks – and to peel back the layers of abstraction to get to know the underlying principles that all these technologies have in common.

Understanding what coding is at a fundamental level will make solving problems easier and will give you a better understanding of how these technologies work underneath the hood.

In this article we will learn what coding is so you have a solid foundation on which to build.</p>

<h3 style="font-family: 'DejaVu Sans'", >Types of Programming</h3>
<p>Programming is a skill that is becoming increasingly sought after in the job market. Having at least a basic understanding of how software functions is helpful for anyone who interacts with technology. With a background in programming, you can get a job coding, designing software, data architecture, or creating intuitive user interfaces.

But what language should you learn? You'll find a seemingly infinite number of programming languages that are free to learn and develop projects with online. With the field of technology growing exponentially each year, the internet is a great place to start when trying to explore the latest developments or discover a new skill.

Whichever language you learn, you may find it helpful to take notes or draw diagrams detailing the steps you're taking and why. It's important for programmers to be able to communicate their process to non-technical stakeholders, but taking notes can also be a great learning tool. "Turns out this often comes in handy not only for the sake of creating documentation, but often helps in solving a single task or issue where the underlying tech is challenging to understand," offers Eric Hartzog, a software engineer at Meta.</p>
